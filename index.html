                    This is a page I made in honour of Cruelty Squad, one of the most memorable games I have ever played. A truly immersive experience in both content and form. Proof of how much I love it is that I actually bought it instead of just pirating it. <span class='fas fa-skull-crossbones'></span><br>I'm currently working through a freeCodeCamp certification in <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a> and this site is one of my projects. The other ones can be seen on my <a href="https://hdarlim.github.io/">GitHub page</a>. Cheers.
